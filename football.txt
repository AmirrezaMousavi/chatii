The 26-year-old continues to be linked to the European champions after Cristiano Ronaldo's departure, but the club say they will not be making a bid
Real Madrid have released a statement insisting they have "no plans" to make an approach for Paris Saint-Germain star Neymar.

The European champions have been heavily linked with a move for the Brazil forward as a big-name replacement for Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Juventus in a deal worth €100m (£88m/$117m) plus €12m (£10.5/$14m) in additional charges .

Neymar, who scored twice at the World Cup in Russia, was already believed to be in the club's sights prior to Ronaldo's shock decision to pursue a new opportunity.

Once again, the Spainish giants have moved to put an end to speculation by claiming they have not held discussions with the former Barcelona man over a potential return to La Liga.

"Given the constant information linking the PSG player Neymar with our club, Real Madrid CF wants to clarify that it has no plans to make any offers for the player," a club statement read.

"The relationship between the two clubs is extraordinary, so that, if at some point Real Madrid were considering signing a PSG player, the first thing it would do would be to go to his club."

It is the second statement Madrid have made to dismiss rumours of interest in Neymar in July, having already denied talk of a €310 million (£275m/$360m) transfer.salam
